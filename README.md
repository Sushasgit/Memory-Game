# About
This fun and funky concentration game will keep you mentally on your toes, and the cute and quirky characters will keep you smiling!
You can change Memory Game setup choosing options below. Choose different table layout, and you can choose to play against the clock.Â 
# Rules
* Shuffle the cards and lay them on the table, face down, in rows.
* On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time) and keeps them if the cards match (in our case, two same persons)
* If they successfully match a pair they get to keep the cards.
* When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position)
* The trick is to remember cards location across the layout.
# Technologies used
* CSS pre-processor (SASS)
* JavaScript
* Media Queries
* Semantic elements in markup structure
